### Install Notes
- For better trackpad support go to `System Preferences -> Trackpad` and disable `Force click and haptic feedback`

### Secure Boot
If you want to boot without the anoing red bar with the lock icon you can try [this workaround](https://github.com/badstorm/surface-pro-7-opencore/blob/master/SecureBoot.With.Grub.md). *Thanks to @Xiashangning*
